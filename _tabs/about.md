Welcome to my little place on the internet.

I started this blog early 2022 in hopes of sharing my adventures with tinkering and exploring all types of devices, how they work, and what role they may play in our daily lives.

I remember getting my first computer when I was still very young, the popular 286/386 machines. Ever since then I spent copious amounts of time messing with the components, swapping out memory modules, hard drives (which were literally the size of bricks), and a whole host of other peripherals.

On Mike’s Base, you will find my ever growing library of home brew projects ranging from all things computers, networking, and automotive. I hope these shared projects will help and inspire others to become tinkers and explorers and to serve a guide to come up with your own projects as well.
